    <h1>West Charlotte </h1>

      <h1>Urban & Historical</h1>
      <p>In west Charlotte, you’ll find some of the most reasonable housing prices in the city. And as you travel farther into the northwestern
        portion of the county, you’ll find some of the most unspoiled beauty in the entire Charlotte area.<br>

        <br>The west and northwest regions encompass urban areas near Uptown and extend west to the Gaston County line, northwest to Mountain Island
        Lake and north to Lake Norman. Real estate listings are in areas 8 and 9.<br>
          
        <br>In town, this area offers easy access to Uptown, interstates and other major thoroughfares, including Wilkinson Boulevard, West Trade 
        Street, Beatties Ford Road and Statesville Road. You’ll find reasonably priced bungalow-style homes in some quaint, older neighborhoods 
        near downtown.<br>
          
        <br>Wesley Heights, just across I-77 from Uptown, is one of Charlotte’s earliest streetcar suburbs. Named a National Register Historic 
        District, Wesley Heights is characterized by tree-lined streets and bungalows as well as Tudor and Colonial Revival homes, similar to 
        those in Dilworth. Although home prices in Wesley Heights are nearing those of other urban neighborhoods like Dilworth and Plaza-Midwood, 
        you can still find a fixer-upper in the low $200s.<br>
          
        <br>The area is quickly attracting new urban developers. Lela Court, a Beazer Homes development in Wesley Heights, includes 83 new townhomes 
        priced in the low to mid-$200s. Right down the street, Bungalows at Lela Court, starting at $250,000, includes 21 homes that borrow an 
        architectural style from the 1920s.<br>
        
        <br>Nearby, the Irwin Creek and Stewart Creek greenways compose a two-mile trail that winds through the Wesley Heights neighborhood to Uptown, 
        linking Bruns Avenue Elementary to Ray’s Splash Planet and Frazier Park.<br>
          
        <br>Also near the center of town is Johnson C. Smith University off West Trade Street. The university is a private, historically black, 
        four-year liberal arts institution located on a 100-acre campus within blocks of Uptown. The school is hailed by U.S. News and World Report
        as one of the top comprehensive colleges in the South. JCSU offers 1,500 students academically progressive programs in 27 different majors.
        The school recently completed a $6.6 million restoration of Biddle Memorial Hall, a 120-year-old administration building that has been 
        designated a National Historic Landmark.</p>
